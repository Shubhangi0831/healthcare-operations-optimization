# Business Case: Healthcare Operations Optimization

## Project Context

This initiative began when a local hospital faced significant operational disruptions due to a lack of queue transparency. During an emergency surgery, patients waited for hours without information, leading to panic and unrest in the waiting area. The hospital, managed by only two doctors, lacked both the technical infrastructure and budget for a digital solution. I volunteered to build one as a student in Business Analytics, aiming to improve operational efficiency.

## Business Problem

- No digital appointment or queue tracking system
- 3+ hour wait times during peak hours or emergencies
- No communication mechanism for doctor status
- Manual scheduling with paper/phone led to confusion
- Patients grew restless and overwhelmed front-desk staff

## Objective

To build a cost-effective, AI-assisted digital system to manage patient appointments and queues in real time, improve transparency, and reduce administrative chaos.

## Constraints

- No technical staff or budget
- Must work on all devices (phones, tablets, desktops)
- Minimal disruption to current manual process

## Solution Overview

Developed a lightweight web application with:
- **Patient Booking Interface**
- **Live Queue Display**
- **Doctor Dashboard with Real-time Status Control**
- **Reschedule Flow for Duplicates**
- **Mobile Responsive UI**

AI tools assisted in building both frontend and backend logic, while I directed the design, workflow, and logic.

## Features

- Book appointments by name, date, phone
- Track queue status with live updates
- Doctors update availability: Available, In Surgery, In Rounds
- Duplicate appointment warning and reschedule option
- Live queue resets with timestamp tracking

## Projected Business Impact

- **70% reduction** in admin time spent on queue handling
- **80% improvement** in wait-time clarity for patients
- Less emotional toll on doctors/staff during emergencies
- Increased patient satisfaction via transparency

## Development Approach

- Self-led with AI-assisted coding
- User-centered feedback from hospital staff
- Prototyped and iteratively improved using VS Code and Flask

## Future Roadmap

- SMS alert integration
- Google Sheets sync for logs
- Pilot test with hospital once stabilized
